                <p>Caitlin works across genres and formats as a screenwriter in television & film. Her credits include the half-hour kid’s series, Jane, for Apple TV+ and the half-hour comedy, Cavendish, for CBC. Caitlin is currently working on the horror movie musical, Fight The Moonlight, with co-creator Tricia Black in development at Highball TV. Caitlin and Tricia are co-creators of the upcoming digital series, Tales From The B-Side: Dusk, with Shaftesbury’s KindaTV.</p>
                <p>Caitlin has worked extensively in the romance MOW space. Her produced credits include Lifetime’s The Christmas Temp (written by) and Christmas Movie Magic (story by). Caitlin co-wrote the queer love story Christmas In The Making for Blue Ice Pictures and has written original romance treatments for Chesler Perlmutter Productions and Peacock Alley Entertainment.</p>
                <p>Caitlin worked alongside creative partners Kawennáhere Devery Jacobs and DW Waterson to write multiple indie dramas, including the feature film adaptation, Bitter Sweat, which was supported by Telefilm’s Talent To Watch 2020.</p>
                <p>Caitlin is a recipient of the 2020 Netflix-BANFF Diversity of Voices Initiative and the 2019 Magee TV Diverse Screenwriters Mentorship.</p>
                <p>Caitlin is also crazy about mysteries, which led her to script immersive escape games for Escape Manor. Caitlin’s short films and sketches are viewable online through

                <h2 class="about-header">Style & Inspiration</h2>
                <p>I am driven by a deep curiosity in people, and why they do what they do. I write humour in tragedy. Drama in the comedic. Tension with a sense of play. My tone is hopeful, and a tad feral. I’m drawn to genre storytelling. Mystery. Adventure. Coming-of-age growing pains. And always, <span class="italics">always</span>, the desire to belong. I value community & collaboration. My worldview has been shaped through a female lens as a queer/bi person from an ancestry of Irish/English settlers. I live in Toronto / Tkaronto on Treaty 13 territory in Canada / Turtle Island. Go Raptors, go!</p>

                <h2 class="about-header">Cutting My Teeth</h2>
                <p>My formal training is in Visual Arts & Dramatic Arts. My early career was in theatre – specifically in collective creation, which inspired me to pursue TV writing. I spent two years doing stand up and three years intensely involved in Toronto’s improv community. During this time I co-wrote and produced online sketches with Arms Up Comedy and wrote scripts for immersive escape games. I prioritized international travel through my teens and twenties, lived and studied abroad, and did every gig job under the sun.</p>
