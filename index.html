                <span>
                    I’m Caitlin. I’m a collaborative writer and a keen story editor.</span>
            </h2>
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>I work across formats, including half-hour comedy, one-hour drama, TV movies, feature film and
                    adaptation. There is always friendship, adventure, and a coming of age journey. Aren’t those the
                    best parts of life?</p>
                <p>I write stories that center on community and the desire to belong in worlds that evoke the
                    mysterious and the intimate.</p>
                <p>My tone ranges from feral, to funny, to full of heart.</p>
                <p>My worldview has been shaped through a female lens as a bi/queer person. I am driven by a deep
                    interest in people, and why they do what they do.</p>
                <p>I spent a decade traveling, working odd jobs, and figuring out how to write. My formal training
                    and early career was in theatre – specifically in collective creation, which inspired me to
                    pursue TV writing. I spent two years doing stand up and three years deeply involved in Toronto’s
                    improv community. During this time I also co-wrote and produced online sketches with Arms Up
                    Comedy and wrote scripts for immersive escape games.</p>
                <p>Fun personal fact: I have a toe thumb. Yes, it makes bowling difficult.
