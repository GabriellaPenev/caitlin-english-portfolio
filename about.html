                    <p>
                        I work across formats, including half-hour comedy, one-hour drama, TV movies, feature film and
                        adaptation. There is always friendship, adventure, and a coming of age journey. Aren’t those the
                        best parts of life?
                        I write stories that center on community and the desire to belong in worlds that evoke the
                        mysterious and the intimate.
                        My tone ranges from feral, to funny, to full of heart.
                        My worldview has been shaped through a female lens as a bi/queer person. I am driven by a deep
                        interest in people, and why they do what they do.
                    </p>

                    How I became a screenwriter…
                </p> -->
                    <p>
                        I spent a decade traveling, working odd jobs, and figuring out how to write.
                        My formal training and early career was in theatre – specifically in collective creation, which
                        inspired me to pursue TV writing. I spent two years doing stand up and three years deeply
                        involved
                        in Toronto’s improv community. During this time I also co-wrote and produced online sketches
                        with
                        Arms Up Comedy and wrote scripts for immersive escape games.

                        Fun personal fact:
                        I have a toe thumb. Yes, it makes bowling difficult.
